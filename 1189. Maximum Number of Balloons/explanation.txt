for this problem, I used a hashmap. We loop through the given string and ignore any letters that aren'text
in the word balloon. Otherwise, they will be added to our hashmap and we increase the value. AFter
we also check the hashmap to see if it has a value for every letter in balloon. If not, then we 
return 0 as the word balloon cannot be made. Finally, we return the minimum of every value in the dictionary.
notice that since 'l' and 'o' appear twice, we divide their value by 2 to signify that two occurences
of the letter are necessary for one "balloon"
