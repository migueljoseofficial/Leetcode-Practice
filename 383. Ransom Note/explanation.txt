For this problem, I mmiediealty thought of appraoching it with a counts dictionary.
First, I would put all of the letters in the newspaper into a dictionary called counts.
Then I would loop through the ransomeNote, and deal with the edge cases.
1. If the letter isn't in dictionary, then we can immeidately return false
2. If the letter is in the dicionary but the value is zero, then we can return false
3. else we would just subtract one from the counts.
Finally, we return true, if it passes through this for loop!

How can I make it faster?
- add more edge cases?
